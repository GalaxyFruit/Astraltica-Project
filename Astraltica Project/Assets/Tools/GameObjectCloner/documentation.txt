GameObject Cloner:
This tool helps with cloning game objects into any direction, multiple times, with 0 or more offset. it works perfectly for modular assets, using a few elements as shown in the demo video you can create an entire scene in a few minutes by cloning walls/floors/ceilings/decorations/ etc..

How to use:
- Start the tool from Window->GameObject Cloner.
- Select the GameObject(s) you want to clone in the Scene View.
- In the Cloner tool UI choose the Axis(s) (it works with dynamically with local/global directions based on your current selection).
- Input the number of clones for each selected Axis.
- Enter the Distance offset between clones for each selected Axis (if you want to), the default is 0.
- Click "Clone Selected".
- You can Undo multiple selections by clicking "Undo Last Clone".

Please note that Global Space cloning is recommended, while Local Space cloning is only supported for non-hierarchy game objects (with no children) but we're planning to support it for hierarchies in the future.

Package Customization:
- all the logic exists in GOCloner.cs
- the main methos is Clone() which takes the following parameters:
	> Transform tile: the gameobject to clone.
	> int numberOfClones: number of required clones.
	> float distanceBetweenClones: offset distance between clones.
	> int axis: the cloning axis (0: x, 1: y, 2: z)
	> float axisSize: the size of the game object in that axis, which is calculated by the GetSize() method.

Enjoy, and please don't forget to rate and review the asset.
